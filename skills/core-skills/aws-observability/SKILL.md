  auto-instrumentation (ADOT SDKs / CloudWatch agent add-on). CloudWatch Omni (Application
  Observability): SQL over logs/traces, PromQL over metrics, views, dashboards, alerts (vs CloudWatch
  alarms), context graph (GetContextGraph), programmatic access (API/SDK/CLI/CFN), and agent-quality
  evaluation on OTel traces (on-demand scoring, stored-score readback, datasets, online evaluation,

  onboarded Omni Space. For first-time Omni setup only — Space/Domain creation, access
  grants/profiles, ingestion, or ADOT-to-Omni instrumentation for a new Space (NOT Application
  Signals) — use setting-up-cloudwatch-observability.

# AWS Observability

## Overview

Domain expertise for AWS observability across metrics, logs, and traces, for **two
products** that share the CloudWatch name but are separate services with separate
control planes, data models, and APIs:

| | CloudWatch | CloudWatch Omni |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | Log groups, metric namespaces, alarms, Log Insights, X-Ray, Application Signals | Application Observability / Agent Observability. A **Space** per account per Region is the access boundary over the account's CloudWatch **Dataset** (OpenTelemetry logs, traces, and metrics); the Dataset is a CloudWatch resource the Space reads, not something the Space contains |
| **Control plane** | `aws cloudwatch`, `aws logs`, `aws xray`, `aws application-signals` | `aws cloudwatch-omni` (endpoint prefix `cloudwatch-omni`, signing name `cloudwatch`) |
| **Query** | Log Insights query language; GetMetricData | SQL over `logs.default` / `traces.default`; PromQL over metrics; named views |
| **Notify** | Alarms (metric, composite, anomaly) | **Alerts** (SQL/PromQL rule, contributors, OK/WARNING/CRITICAL/NODATA) |
| **Topology** | Application Signals service map | **Context graph** (GetContextGraph) |
| **Access** | IAM only | Domain → Space → **access grants** and **access profiles** (set up in `setting-up-cloudwatch-observability`) |
| **Only here** | Dynamic Instrumentation, Synthetics canaries, CloudTrail auditing, EMF | Agent-quality evaluation, views, context graph |
| **References** | `references/cloudwatch/` | `references/cloudwatch-omni/` |

Enabling Omni does not replace CloudWatch; log groups, metrics, and alarms keep
working, and most customers use both.

**Works best with** the [AWS MCP server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mcp/) — enables
running CLI commands, querying CloudWatch, and validating configurations directly. All
guidance also works with standard AWS CLI access.

**Note:** Reference files contain specific runtime versions, quota values, and feature
matrices that may change. When precision matters (e.g. deploying to production, choosing a
runtime, or checking a quota), confirm values against current AWS documentation rather
than relying solely on the values in these files.

## Step 0 — CloudWatch or CloudWatch Omni?

Decide this before routing. The natural wording ("set up an alert for high latency",
"build a dashboard", "query my logs") does not say which product the customer means.

1. **The customer names the product** — "Omni", "Application Observability", "Agent
   Observability", a Space, Domain, Dataset, access grant, `spaceId`, `cloudwatch-omni`,
   Omni SQL, PromQL, views, context graph, evaluators → **Omni**. "Log Insights", "log
   group", "metric namespace", "CloudWatch alarm", "metric alarm", "composite alarm",
   "anomaly alarm", "X-Ray", "Application Signals", "canary", "CloudTrail", "Dynamic
   Instrumentation" → **CloudWatch**. A bare "alarm" (or "alert") with no other product
   signal is ambiguous — fall through to rule 3 and probe: a Space → Omni alert
   ([alerts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/alerts.md)); no Space → CloudWatch alarm
   ([cloudwatch/alarms.md](references/cloudwatch/alarms.md)). Exception: a "PromQL
   **alarm**" is a CloudWatch alarm on OTel metrics
   ([cloudwatch/alarms.md](references/cloudwatch/alarms.md)) — "alarm" wins over "PromQL".
2. **Knowledge or how-to question** ("what is an Omni alert", "does Omni have an API",
   "how do alerts differ from alarms") → answer from the reference files directly. Do
   **not** probe the account, and do not divert to the other product. Whether a
   capability exists is a fact about the product, not the account.
   [concepts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/concepts.md) carries the full feature-equivalence matrix.
3. **Request that must act on live data, and the wording is ambiguous** → probe the target
   Region before acting:

   ```
   aws___call_aws → aws cloudwatch-omni list-domains
   aws___call_aws → aws cloudwatch-omni list-spaces        # scope to the target Region
   ```

   - A Domain and a Space exist in that Region → **Omni**.
   - No Space → **CloudWatch**: alarms → [cloudwatch/alarms.md](references/cloudwatch/alarms.md),
     dashboards → [cloudwatch/dashboards.md](references/cloudwatch/dashboards.md), queries →
     [cloudwatch/log-insights.md](references/cloudwatch/log-insights.md), metrics →
     [cloudwatch/metrics.md](references/cloudwatch/metrics.md). If the customer explicitly asked
     for Omni and has no Space, that is a first-time setup — see step 4.
   - The probe itself errors ("not yet supported", unknown service, endpoint does not
     resolve) → the CLI/SDK model in use lacks `cloudwatch-omni`. That is **not** evidence
     Omni is absent and must not be reported as "Omni is unavailable". The customer's
     installed AWS CLI/SDK most likely predates the service. If the request carried
     **any** Omni signal, have them upgrade (AWS CLI v2 reinstall or `brew upgrade
     awscli`; `pip install -U boto3 botocore`) and re-run `aws cloudwatch-omni
     list-domains` — exact steps in
     [programmatic-access.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/programmatic-access.md); never
     substitute a CloudWatch or X-Ray command for an Omni request. If the request
     carried **no** Omni signal, do not block on the upgrade: proceed on the CloudWatch
     path (the pre-Omni default) and mention the upgrade only in passing.
   - Still inconclusive → ask the customer.
4. **First-time Omni setup** — creating a Domain or Space, granting access, provisioning
   ingestion, forwarding log groups into the Dataset, connecting Slack, or instrumenting
   an application or AI agent so traces reach a Space → **STOP and route to the
   `setting-up-cloudwatch-observability` skill.** This skill covers a Space that already
   has data. An instrumentation / ADOT / OTel-collector request that names neither
   Application Signals, ServiceEvents, or the `amazon-cloudwatch-observability` add-on
   nor Omni or a Space is ambiguous — probe `list-spaces` in the
   target Region: a Space → route to the `setting-up-cloudwatch-observability` skill's
   application-instrumentation reference (plain ADOT SDK, no add-on); no Space →
   [cloudwatch/application-signals-onboarding.md](references/cloudwatch/application-signals-onboarding.md).

A Space is **one per account per Region** — probe the Region the request targets. An Omni
query against the wrong Region returns an empty result that is easily misread as "no data".

## Routing — CloudWatch (`references/cloudwatch/`)

| User need | Action |

| CloudTrail operational auditing | Read [cloudtrail.md](references/cloudwatch/cloudtrail.md) |
| Setting up Lambda monitoring with CDK | Use [alarm-template.ts](assets/cloudwatch/alarm-template.ts) as a starting point |
| Creating synthetic canaries | Read [synthetics.md](references/cloudwatch/synthetics.md) |
| Configuring ADOT collector | Use [otel-config.yaml](assets/cloudwatch/otel-config.yaml) as a starting point |
| Debugging a running service with breakpoints/snapshots — Dynamic Instrumentation (**modifies live services and captures live data**) | Read [dynamic-instrumentation.md](references/cloudwatch/dynamic-instrumentation.md) in full before acting. Confirm with the user before any create/delete, and narrate before significant actions: observation → hypothesis → proposed action → expected result. Source inspection alone identifies hypotheses, not confirmed root causes; keep suspected causes tentative until runtime evidence confirms them. |

## Routing — CloudWatch Omni (`references/cloudwatch-omni/`)

Rows that **act on live Space data** assume Step 0 found a Space. Knowledge questions are
answered from the file directly.

| User need | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Concepts.** What Omni is, what a Domain / Space / Dataset / grant / profile / view / alert / context graph is, whether a feature is Omni or CloudWatch, where setup starts | Read [concepts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/concepts.md) |
| **Query logs or traces** — SQL (`SELECT … FROM logs.default / traces.default / default`), field access, schema discovery, span duration, TABLESAMPLE | Read [query/sql-logs-traces.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/sql-logs-traces.md) |
| **Query metrics** — PromQL, which metric answers which symptom per AWS service, why a metric is missing, gauge vs counter | Read [query/promql-metrics.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/promql-metrics.md). Metrics are PromQL, never SQL |
| **Views** — create, manage, or query named reusable SQL (`FROM view.<name>`) | Read [query/views.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/views.md) |
| **Dashboards in Omni** — compose, ground panel queries, author `panels[]`, lay out the grid, the API save semantics (HTTP 200 on any parseable body; validate before save), fix an empty or blank panel, the `*OmniDashboard` APIs | Read [dashboards.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/dashboards.md) |
| **Alerts in Omni** — any mention of an Omni **alert**, `CreateAlert` / `GetAlert` / `ListAlerts` / `UpdateAlert` / `DeleteAlert`, a `profileId`, an alert ARN, or how alerts differ from alarms; create, tune, tag, list, delete; notifications | Read [alerts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/alerts.md). The alert API is real and first-class — do NOT redirect to CloudWatch alarms. For CloudWatch alarms when Omni is not enabled, read [cloudwatch/alarms.md](references/cloudwatch/alarms.md) |
| **Context graph** — why is service X slow or failing, what depends on it, upstream/downstream, blast radius, walking from an insight or anomaly to a root cause, `GetContextGraph` | Read [context-graph.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/context-graph.md) |
| **Agent evaluation** — score traces on demand, choose an evaluator, read back stored `gen_ai.evaluation.*` scores ("which evaluators are doing worst", "which online evaluators are unhealthy / underperforming"), build datasets from traces, set up online evaluation, author a custom evaluator, audit whether an agent's traces are flowing | Read [agent-evaluation.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/agent-evaluation.md) |
| **Programmatic access** — "is there an API or SDK for Omni", calling Omni from code, CI, IaC, or an AI coding agent | Read [programmatic-access.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/programmatic-access.md). Omni has a real public SigV4 API; never answer that it has none, never substitute the CloudWatch or X-Ray CLI/SDK, and answer without probing for a Space |
| **Who has access to a Space**, granting or revoking access, access profiles, creating a Space or Domain, ingestion, forwarding, Slack, Azure, instrumenting an app or AI agent | Route to the **`setting-up-cloudwatch-observability`** skill |
| Spans multiple areas | Read the most specific reference first, then consult others as needed |
