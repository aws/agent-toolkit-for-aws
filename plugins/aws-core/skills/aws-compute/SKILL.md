# Amazon EC2 Compute

Best experience with the AWS MCP server; also works with the AWS CLI alone — no hard dependency on either.

## Critical Warnings

**Launch configurations are deprecated** and do not support current EC2 instance types; new accounts cannot create them. Use launch templates for every new Auto Scaling group. See [auto-scaling.md](references/auto-scaling.md).

**ASGs ignore ELB health checks by default**: An Auto Scaling group only uses EC2 status checks unless you set `--health-check-type ELB`. Without it, instances failing the load balancer's health check stay in service forever. See [auto-scaling.md](references/auto-scaling.md).

**IMDSv2 hop limit breaks containers**: the default `HttpPutResponseHopLimit` of 1 makes the IMDSv2 token PUT response fail to reach a containerized process (the extra hop exceeds the response TTL), so the token request times out. Set `HttpPutResponseHopLimit=2` for bridge/awsvpc container workloads. (If IMDSv2 is *required*, a subsequent tokenless GET returns `401`; if optional, it silently falls back to IMDSv1.) See [provisioning.md](references/provisioning.md).

**T3/T3a/T4g default to unlimited mode**: Unlike T2 (standard), these burst without throttling but bill surplus CPU credits when 24h-average CPU exceeds baseline — a silent cost leak. See [instance-selection.md](references/instance-selection.md).

**Instance store is ephemeral**: Data on instance store volumes is lost on stop, hibernate, terminate, instance-type change, and host failure — it survives only a reboot. Put anything durable on EBS/EFS/S3. See [instance-selection.md](references/instance-selection.md).

## Common Workflows

**"Stand up an autoscaling web fleet"** → Create a launch template (AMI, type, IMDSv2), then an ASG referencing it with `--health-check-type ELB` and a target-tracking policy, see [auto-scaling.md](references/auto-scaling.md). For the public entry point, secure the load balancer (TLS/ACM, WAF, security response headers) per the Security Considerations below and the load-balancer notes in [auto-scaling.md](references/auto-scaling.md) — the load-balancer build itself belongs to `aws-networking`.

**"Roll out a new AMI to my fleet"** → New launch template version → instance refresh; pin a numeric launch-template version so rollback works, see [auto-scaling.md](references/auto-scaling.md).

**"Connect to a private instance without a bastion"** → Give the instance SSM permissions (an instance profile with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`, or account-level DHMC) plus a network path, then use Session Manager, see [systems-manager.md](references/systems-manager.md).

**"Cut EC2 cost"** → Right-size (burstable vs fixed-performance), Graviton where the app supports Arm64, Spot with `price-capacity-optimized` for fault-tolerant fleets, release idle Elastic IPs, see [instance-selection.md](references/instance-selection.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Quick fix |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| SSH "Connection timed out" | Network path (SG/NACL/route/no public IP) | Open TCP 22 from your IP; check route to IGW; verify public IP — see [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) |
| SSH "Connection refused" | Host: sshd down or still booting | Wait for boot; check sshd/port via Session Manager or serial console |
| `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` | AWS lacks capacity of that type in the AZ (NOT a quota) | Try another AZ / instance type / retry; don't request a quota increase |
| `InstanceLimitExceeded` | vCPU quota reached (this IS a quota) | Request a Service Quotas increase for the instance family |
| ASG never replaces LB-unhealthy instances | Health check type still EC2 | Set `--health-check-type ELB` |
| Instances stuck in `Pending:Wait`, terminated after ~1h | Lifecycle hook never completed (heartbeat 3600s, default ABANDON) | Call `complete-lifecycle-action` CONTINUE, or set DefaultResult CONTINUE |
| System status check failed | AWS host/hardware | Stop/start to migrate to new hardware (reboot won't) |
| Instance status check failed | Instance OS/network config | Reboot or fix the OS/network config |

## Security Considerations

- **Enforce IMDSv2** (`HttpTokens=required`) on launch templates to block SSRF-based credential theft; set the account-level default per Region (applies to new launches only).
- **Prefer Session Manager over inbound SSH** — no open port 22, no key management, and a CloudTrail record of session API calls; enable Session Manager session logging to CloudWatch Logs/S3 (off by default) to capture the in-session commands themselves — see [systems-manager.md](references/systems-manager.md).
- **Use instance profiles, never embedded credentials**; scope the role to least privilege.
- **Encrypt EBS/AMIs**; to share an encrypted AMI cross-account, re-encrypt under a customer-managed KMS key (the default `aws/ebs` key can't be shared).
- **Enable CloudTrail** in all Regions to audit EC2/ASG/SSM API activity, and alarm on sensitive actions (security-group changes, `RunInstances`/`TerminateInstances` from unexpected principals) so unauthorized changes surface.
- **For public-facing web fleets**, encrypt traffic in transit with an ACM certificate on the load balancer's HTTPS listener and add AWS WAF for defense in depth against common web exploits — the load-balancer/WAF setup itself lives in `aws-networking`.
- For hardening beyond this guidance, see [AWS EC2 security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security.html) and CIS Benchmarks for the guest OS.
